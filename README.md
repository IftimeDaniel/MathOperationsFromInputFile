Programming Assignment:

Write a script/program that reads a sequence of mathematical expressions from a file and prints the result of evaluating all expressions in the order they appear.
The file consists of a series of expressions, one per line.
Each line is in the format function [value]. ADD 5, for example, adds 5 to the current value. The initial value when the program starts is 0. A file contains maximum ten rows.

Following functions are supported:

ADD n -- (addition, +)
SUB n -- (subtraction, -)
MUL n -- (multiplication, *)
DIV n -- (division, /)
SQR -- (square, Â²)
